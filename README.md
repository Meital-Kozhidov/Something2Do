# Something2Do Home Assignment for SysAid

### General note:

As mentioned by you, time was limited, so the task is not perfect.
It was the first time of me working with Spring.
I wish I had more time to perfect it.
Anyhow, I learned a lot and really enjoyed the process.

## Options for improvements in the future:

1. Database addition for keeping the state consistent (between server restarts).
2. Caching mechanism for tasks.
3. Make the system more dyamic - more options for the user, for example: get the most rated task.
4. Login system, and from there also a role system, for example an admin role that can modify and delete existing tasks.
5. More excessive tests.
6. A nice UI :)
