# Something2Do Home Assignment for SysAid

### General note:

As mentioned in the assignment, time was limited, so the task is not perfect.
It was the first time of me working with Spring.
I wish I had more time to perfect it, but I'm generally pleased with the result.
I learned a lot and really enjoyed the process.
Thank you in advance for viewing my code :)

## Options for improvements in the future:

1. Database addition for keeping the state consistent (between server restarts).
2. Caching mechanism for tasks.
3. Make the system more dynamic - more options for the user, for example: get the most rated task.
4. Login system, and from there also a role system, for example an admin role that can modify and delete existing tasks.
5. More excessive tests.
6. A nice UI :)
